## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.
Some pages require a user to be logged-in and authenticated, in order to view the page. so I have used the
[validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method, which requires you to copy/paste
the entire HTML code into the validator.

Pages that have (validate by input) next to them, require you to copy/paste the entire HTML code into the validator.

| Page                                    | W3C URL                                                                                     | Screenshot                                                                    | Notes     |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

There is only one single css file compiled & minified from all the other css files.

> üî•**Important**
>
> CSS validation has returned 56 CSS parsing errors. This issue is a result of the final ccs build
> using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). The maintainer of TailwindCSS has discussed this issue and provided a
> solution; however, the recommended fix cannot be used as it is causing issues with the styles used within the
>
application. [Remove --tw- variables from universal selector #7317](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/7317)
> üîó

### TypeScript

I have used [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) to validate all of my TypeScript files. I have used the recommended
Eslint & [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/) plugins to validate all of my TS files with a custom
configuration located in `.tsconif.json` at the root directory.

This evolved using pnpm to install the Eslint with TypeScript plugins located in `package.json` located at the root
directory. I can run the following command to validate all of my TS files:

> **Note**
>
> You will need to have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed to run the following command, or you can use npm or yarn.

```bash
pnpm  eslint --fix-dry-run static/src/js/main.ts
```

The ide im using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac) is also highlighting any
TypeScript / Eslint errors in the code. This is based on the configuration in
the `.eslintrc.yml` & `tsconfig.json` file.

Pycharm generated report:

|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Pycharm inspection report | ![screenshot](../docs/testing/jetbrains/javascript/pycharm-report.png) | Eslint redundant double negation (no-extra-boolean-cast) |

### Python

I have used the
recommended [PyCharm quality Assistance](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/tutorial-code-quality-assistance-tips-and-tricks.html)
with built-in pep8 support to validate all of my Python files. This provides both instant analyses of the code along
with ability to generate a report. All python files were validated using pycharm inspection tools with the exceptions of
the following files:

- `All files located in migrations directories`
- `__init__.py`

| File                      | Screenshot                                                      | Notes     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| pycharm inspection report | ![screenshot](../docs/testing/jetbrains/python/pep8-report.png) | No errors |

> **IMPORTANT**: Django settings.py
>
> The Django settings.py has been configured to ignore the following errors:
> - `E501 line too long (82 > 79 characters)`

`noqa` = **NO Quality Assurance**

Example:

```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
]

## Browser testing

I utilised both manual and automated testing to test the application on various browsers and devices.
I used the following browsers to test the application:

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)

### Manual testing

Pages tested:

| Page                        | Sizes                     | Notes             |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| About page                  | Mobile - Tablet - Desktop | Works as expected |
| Booking page                | Mobile - Tablet - Desktop | Works as expected |

| Register Page               | Mobile - Tablet - Desktop | Works as expected |
| Reservations Page           | Mobile - Tablet - Desktop | Works as expected |

> **Note**
>
> I used [Polypane](https://polypane.app/) to test the application on multiple devices at the same time
> with the following configurations to ensure the application is responsive on all devices:
>
> - Mobile: 375px x 812px
> - Tablet: 744px x 1024px
> - Desktop: 1440px x 1080px

After inspection of all pages, I took screenshots of each page & on all device sizes noted above. They are available in
the [polypane folder](../docs/testing/polypane/) directory. Due
to the number of pages and screens tested, I have only included a few examples below.

| Page      | Mobile                                                              | Tablet                                                              | Desktop                                                               | Notes             |

### Automated testing

I used [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to test the application on multiple browsers and devices. The following
browsers & user actions were tested:

> **Note**
>
> All tests where recorded and are available in the [playwright folder](../docs/testing/e2e/playwright/videos)
> directory. Below are a few examples of the tests, you can find the playwright test files in the
> [test/playwright](../tests/playwright) directory.

## Lighthouse Audit

I used [Lighthouse cli](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) to audit the application. I tested the application
for each page on both mobile and desktop devices.

> **Note**
>
> I Added the results to the [lighthouse folder](../docs/testing/lighthouse) directory. It contains an HTML report for
> each page and device size. Please note I originally named the heroku url **django-suhshi.herokuapp.com**, but I
> changed
> it to **himawari-sushi.herokuapp.com**. The lighthouse reports are named using the original url; however, the results
> are correct. This change was for consistency with the project name.

## Python coverage

I used [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/) package to test the python code coverage. I used the CLI to run the tests and generate the report. All results are in the [coverage folder](../tests/htmlcov)

The following table shows the coverage for each app.

| App      | Screen Shot                                                     | Coverage |

| Accounts | ![screenshot](../docs/testing/coverage/report-app-home.png)     | 93%      |
| Booking  | ![screenshot](../docs/testing/coverage/report-app-bookings.png) | 86%      |
| Customer | ![screenshot](../docs/testing/coverage/report-app-customer.png) | 87%      |
| Home     | ![screenshot](../docs/testing/coverage/report-app-home.png)     | 93%      |

## Defensive Programming

Forms:

> **Important**
>
> All forms have validation on the front-end and back-end. The validation rules are set in the model and form classes.
> The front-end validation uses pattern matching to ensure the user enters the correct data type. The back-end
> validation will send an error message if the user enters the wrong data type or if nefarious data is entered.

- Contact form
  - The contact form uses the `required` & `pattern` attribute to ensure the user enters the correct data type.
  - The user will receive an error message if any of the form fields are incorrect.
- Login form
  - The login form uses the `required` & `pattern` attribute to ensure the user enters the correct data type.
  - The user will receive an error message if the username or password is incorrect.
- Register form
  - The register form uses the `required` & `pattern` attribute to ensure the user enters the correct data type.
  - The user will receive an error message if the username or email is already in use.
- Booking form
  - The booking form uses the `required` & `pattern` attribute to ensure the user enters the correct data type.
  - The booking form already has a booking date and time set. The user can only select a date and time in the future.
- Profile form
  - The profile form uses the `required` & `pattern` attribute to ensure the user enters the correct data type.
  - The user will receive an error message if the username or email is already in use.

Prevent unauthorized access (Django middleware):

- Users profile page
  - Users cannot access the profile page if they are not logged in. The user will be redirected to the login page.


- Users bookings / edit or delete booking

## üêõ Bugs

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of in the application. Any bugs that were identified during development were fixed.

## Unfixed Bugs (Python package)

- I am using the [django vite](https://pypi.org/project/django-vite/) pip package to integrate vite into my django project. This is a new package and I have found a bug with it. All css has to be imported into the TypeScript file otherwise the css is loaded by a script tag and not a link tag during production, & causes a `500 server error`. The only workaround is to import the css file into a TypeScript or JavaScript file. This is not ideal as it means I have to import all css files rather than using directly in a html file.
