# UX / UI ðŸŽ¨

[Navigate back to README Documentation](./README.md)

My design process for the Himawari Sushi app began with the use of [Figma design tool](https://www.figma.com/). I
created designs for multiple
screen sizes, including mobile, iPad, and desktop, to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.

To bring our design process to life, I conducted extensive research to choose the perfect colors and images for the
app. Looking at other successful restaurant apps and analyzed their use of color and imagery, as well as researched
the cultural significance of colors in Japanese cuisine.

To complement the imagery of the dishes available, I carefully selected a
color palette that would harmonize with the visual elements and create a cohesive and inviting experience for the users.
By taking the time to research and carefully choose our design elements, we were able to create an app that not only
looks beautiful, but also enhances the overall user experience.
