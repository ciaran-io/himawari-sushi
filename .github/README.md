## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/ciaran-io/himawari-sushi/projects/2) served as an Agile tool for this project.
Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic
Kanban board.

![screenshot](../docs/github/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ciaran-io/django-sushi/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/ciaran-io/himawari-sushi/issues)

  ![screenshot](../docs/github/gh-issues-open.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/ciaran-io/himawari-sushi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

  ![screenshot](../docs/github/gh-issues-closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration
